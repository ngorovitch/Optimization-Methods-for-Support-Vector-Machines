# Optimization-Methods-for-Support-Vector-Machines
Implementation of Support Vector Machine from scratch.  We trained SVM using 3 opimization methods: full QP,  decomposition method and the Most Violating Pair (MVP) decomposition method . Additionally as a bonus, we implemented a Support Vector Machine classiﬁer for multi-class classiﬁcation
